Hi there. 

From now on I will not publish any further works on GitHub and will delete the existing ones: being sold inside a Frankensteinian output of some obsure NN was never my plan. If anything of it was valuable for you (I doubt that honestly), please, check the repo with the same name on my codeberg account: I've moved some of my stuff there. I still plan to use this account as a regular proprietary social network page: to communicate with the people trapped inside. 

It is obviosly a sad state of affairs; but, well, thanks for the ride, octocat.
